1) Firstly clone this github repo in you laptops. For that you can simply pull the repo form the link "https://github.com/xaugatp/AWT.git"
2) Next step is to activate the virtual environment.
    For that open your terminal in vs code and type "myenv\Scripts\Activate". Make sure you have pythonb and pip installed in your laptop. 
3) If you are sucessfull upto this point then you will see (myenv) in your terminal. 
4) Next step is to install the dependencies, for that type "pip install -r requirements.txt"
5) Then start doing your allocated part. 

6) Create a front end simulating the original Torrens University website landing page.Same like this "https://www.torrens.edu.au/", we will click our group photo and we will replace it. 
7) Next step is to add the small button or a lono or text   saying chat with ai/ ask anything/ 24/7 support like that .
8) That button should have drop up feature and once the user click it, it shoul open a interface like chatgpt or deep seek. 
9) Over there User should be able to type their query.
10) That user query will hit the backend and using embedding we will change it to vector form.
11) That will be ranked by the RAG.
12) RAG result will be given to LLM. 
13) LLM will give the final response to the end user in the UI. 

Evey time you work.
1) For first time only "git checkout -b your-branch-name" you can put your name insted of your-branch-name
2) SO from next time onwards you can just do
     - "git add ." 
     - git commit -m "Describe the changes you made"
     - "git push -u origin your-branch-name"
